"""Device usability, measured rather than asserted.

Two things this suite holds:

1. Error recovery. A failure the user cannot read is a failure the user
   cannot act on. Every failing path must park on its message until a key is
   pressed, and the sign button must say why it is refusing.
2. Entry cost. The number of button presses per task is a design budget. The
   figures below are the audit's measurements; the test fails if entry gets
   more expensive, so a regression is visible before it reaches a panel.
