"""The QR return channel: what the coordinator's scanner actually sees.

This suite exists because the review found D11 and D12 shipped untested.
A signed PSBT leaves Corky as pixels on a panel, so the properties that
matter are geometric, not logical: modules must stay square, the quiet zone
must survive, and a multi-frame animation must repeat at a steady rate.
