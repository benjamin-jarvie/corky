"""Property-based and fuzz tests for Corky. Run: python3 tests/test_property.py

A-22 cut this suite from five properties to three. The shim, codex32 and
SeedQR properties went with the modules they tested: the pure signer has no
code that transforms secret material, so there is nothing left to
cross-check against an oracle.

What remains guards the two things Corky still does with untrusted input,
and the one number it computes:

  1. PSBT boundary fuzz: FrameAssembler.feed and read_psbt never raise an
     uncaught exception on garbage, only their controlled errors.
  2. Fee and amount Decimal arithmetic in describe_psbt is exact.
