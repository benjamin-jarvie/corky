"""Typing a paper backup back in, and being told exactly what is wrong.

The last backup page offered VERIFY for months and then just returned to
the menu (Ben, on the board, 2026-09-05). This is the flow it now runs.

These checks are in-process rather than in an end-to-end session because
every screen in the flow shows key material, so hal.DevDisplay blanks the
frames a scripted session writes: the session can prove the flow COMPLETES
but cannot see what it said. Here the screens are rendered directly and the
loop is driven with a scripted keypad, so the wrong character is visible.
