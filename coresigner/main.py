"""Core Signer's session state machine: the program the device boots into.

States. Every tile is a JOB, not a device (Ben, 2026-09-05). The camera is
a means: Sign uses it for a transaction, Keys for a key, Tools to check an
address. Naming the first tile after the camera made it the place
everything happened, and then no word fitted it.

  HOME (2x2: sign / keys / tools / settings)
    SIGN  -> a transaction, from the camera or a stick
          -> REVIEW -> sign -> RESULT, which offers SIGN ANOTHER or
             POWER OFF. Back returns to HOME, keys still loaded (D7).
    KEYS  -> the loaded keys by fingerprint, then New key, Scan a key,
             Type private key (A-22: only forms Core reads)
          -> one key: export public key, receiving addresses, backup
             key, discard key
    TOOLS -> the device, not your keys: check for leaks, check an address
  Power off lives in SETTINGS (PLAN A-15c).

Every screen comes from screens.py, every wallet operation from signer.py,
every transfer from qrchannel/filechannel. This module holds no crypto and
parses no untrusted bytes; it is the traffic cop.

QR input arrives through a QrSource: on the device that is the camera (M1);
in dev mode it reads payloads from files so every state is exercisable
without hardware.

Dev mode:
    python3 coresigner/main.py --dev --datadir <dir> --chain regtest \
        --script "<keys>" [--stick-dir DIR] [--qr-psbt FILE]
        [--qr-key FILE] [--frames-dir DIR]
Keys (PLAN A-15c, eight controls): u/d/l/r = d-pad, p = centre press,
a = select/KEY1, b = back or delete/KEY2, c = abort/KEY3. Key material
reaches Bitcoin Core through `bitcoin-cli -stdin`, never as an argument,
so it cannot appear in a process listing (signer.Rpc.call, S4).
