"""Core Signer's session flow: everything between loading a key and a signed PSBT.

This module performs no cryptography. It hands Core what the user supplied,
then drives Bitcoin Core over RPC. Core does all key derivation, all PSBT
parsing, all fee arithmetic and all signing. Every function here is plumbing.

The front end (screen/camera) calls exactly four things per session:
    open_session_xprv(xprv) / open_session_descriptors(descs)
    describe_psbt(psbt_b64)             -> dict for the review screen
    sign_psbt(psbt_b64)                 -> signed PSBT (base64)
    close_session()                     -> wallet unloaded (ramdisk wipe is
                                           the real teardown at power-off)

# "wpkh(): key 'tprv8Zgx...' is not valid"), and Core Signer puts Core's message
# on the panel. Unredacted, that message also reaches stderr, which systemd
# captures into the journal on the SD card. A key on the card is the one
# thing this device must never do.
#: Every prefix a BIP32 extended PRIVATE key can carry, across networks and
#: SLIP-132 script types. One list, so the redactor and the scan classifier
#: cannot disagree about what a private key looks like.
#:
#: The four UPPERCASE forms are SLIP-132's multisig prefixes. They were
#: missing until 2026-09-08, and the list is used for two different jobs,
#: so a Zprv escaped both of them: it was not redacted out of Core's
#: refusal, and it did not trip the stdin guard in Rpc.call, so it went
#: into argv where `ps` reads it. Core Signer does not accept a multisig key and
#: Core refuses one, but the refusal quotes the key back, and by then it
#: had already been on the process list.

#: Core Signer never asks for a WIF, but a person typing a key on a five-way pad
#: can paste or mistype one, and Core echoes what it refused: "key
#: 'cVjzvdHG…' is not valid" reached the panel and the journal in full
