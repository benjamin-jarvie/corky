#: LETTERS FIRST, digits after them. base58's own order puts the digits
#: first, which made the top row of the lowercase grid `1..9abcd` and
#: the top row of the capitals `A..N`, so pressing C changed the whole
#: shape of what you were reading. Letters first means both grids open
#: with the same letters in the same places, and only the tail moves
#: (Ben, on the board, 2026-09-18). Nothing here encodes or decodes
#: base58; this string is the keyboard and its order is a layout.
BASE58 = ("abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789"
          "ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ")                      # 58: no 0, O, I, l

# A passphrase alphabet went with the file backup: the only thing this
# device asks you to type now is a key, and a key is base58 (PLAN A-24).
#: Everything a derivation path is made of and nothing else. A typed
#: path is the only route to a blinded xpub (M1 decision 3), and it is
#: also where a typo is unrecoverable, so the grid offers no character
#: that cannot appear in one.

#: MODES, not pages (map typing, T2). SeedSigner refuses to page a
#: charset at all: its keyboard raises if one will not fit, and the
#: page-turn key it ships is used by no screen. Ben hit the same wall
#: from the other side, walking off an edge to find the capitals with
#: nothing saying they were there.
#:
#: base58 splits 34 and 24. TWELVE columns by THREE rows holds 36, and
#: the third row is what pays for the typed text to be shown as the
#: numbered boxes the paper backup uses. Measured against the pocket
#: panel's budget: two rows of boxes and four grid rows come to 0.995 of
#: the height with no margin at all; three grid rows come to 0.870.
#:
#: Cells go from 26 pixels wide to 18 on a 240 panel. They are pointed
#: at with a cursor, never touched, so what matters is that the glyph is
#: legible and not that the cell is thumb-sized.
GRID_COLS = 13

#: Two keys ON the grid that move the caret instead of typing. This is
#: SeedSigner's answer (map typing, T1): its cursor-left, cursor-right
#: and backspace are keys on the keyboard's last row, reached by
#: navigating to them, so there is no mode to discover and no button to
#: learn. Ours needs only the two arrows, because B already deletes.
#:
#: They are why the grid is 13 columns and not 12: base58's lowercase is
#: 34 and a descriptor's is 36, and both need room for these beside them.
#: ASCII, because the panel font has no arrow glyphs and drew them as
#: empty boxes. Neither character appears in any charset, so neither can
#: be mistaken for one a person meant to type.
